# Challenges and Difficulties

- Relate project objective with data set.
  - Get a big picture of the data set.
    - How many rows and columns of data.
    - What variables we have.
  - Get statistics for the variables.
    - mean, median, variance, min, max, percentile, etc. are helpful for understanding distribution of data.
    - sum basic calculations for the whole data set and for some categories using "groupby" function.
- Which type of visualization should be chosen.
  - Scatter plot for relationship between variables
  - Line chart for trend
  - Pie chart for percentage
  - Bar chart for distribution of data

# Recommendations
To analyze the underserved neighborhood, rural city area, we recommend more insights into both sides of the market in rural city area. We need more information for why rural city area has low total rides, drivers and fares but people who used PyBer rideshare services in that area have the affordability for the service.
